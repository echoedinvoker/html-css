## **Handling text on images**

![Alt handling text on images: darken](pic/12.jpg)

- You don't have to use darken for the whole picture, you can use a gradient to make only the bottom half of the picture darker.

- Be careful with this approach on screens of different sizes, such as cell phones, where other parts of the image may override the text.
