- In addition to **content**, you can also use **attribute** to describe the element.
  - There are even some elements that do not require content at all, but only use attributes to describe, such as **img**.
    - When an element has no content, it does not need to have a **close tag**.
      - but still need to use **'/'** to indicat that.
- The attribute **alt** of the **img** element is not mandatory, but we should use it in every img element to describe the image.
  - there are some reason for it:
    - If you don't use alt to describe the image, **Google search engine** won't know what the image on your element is.
    - **Blind** people can't see the picture, but their browser reads out the alt description.
    - When an image cannot be loaded for some reason, the alt description is used instead.
- We can use the attribute **width** to adjust the image size.
  - There is also an attribute **height**, but it will be **automatically adjusted** according to the ratio of the original image.
    - so there is no need to use it unless you need to change the original image length and width **ratio**.

## **Attributes for other elements**

- The above is demonstration of the **attributes** of some elements other than img.
- **meta** means **metadata**.
  - **metadata** means data of data.
