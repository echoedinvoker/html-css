# **_Semantic HTML_**

## **What's point when we think about elements?**

> When we consider an element, we should not actually consider how the element appears on the page, but rather what the element actually **means** and what it **stands for**.

- Before HTML 5, we used elements **b** and **i**.
  - b means **bold** and i means **italic**, but both bold and italic are only describing the **appearance**, so it is **not considered semantic**.
- After HTML 5 we use the elements **strong** and **em**.
  - The former means the text is **strong** and the latter means the text is **emphasized**.
    - **strong** and **emphasized** are descriptions **other than appearance**, which is **semantic**.

## **Why not just use 'div' to creat boxes?**

- **Before HTML 5** we used element **div** to create boxes to group elements together.
  - But the element **div** has **no semantic**, so after **HTML 5** we use **semantic elements** instead of it.

## **Why Semantics?**

- **Search engin optimization**.
- Writing semantic HTML is extremely important for **accessibility**.
  - especially for people who rely on **screen readers** to consume on web pages.
