- The elements we have taught previously are used as if they are independent and unrelated to each other, but this is not the case, for example, the combination of links in the figure above can be a navigation of the website.

- We can wrap this anchor elements with HTML 5 element **'nav'** to represent a set of navigation.

- We can see that the website is clearly divided into two parts, and we can use the appropriate HTML 5 elements to express this meaning in the codes.

- The content of the element article itself also looks divided into two parts, and can be further divided into groups using HTML 5 elements.

- To indicate the bottom of a web page you can use the HTML element **'footer'**.
  - So, HTML 5 elements can be used **independently**, not necessarily wrapping other elements.
- There are things called **HTML entities** in html that can render various symbols on the page.

## **Why not just use 'div' to group elements?**

- Because of the variety of HTML 5 elements that can represent different **semantics**.
- Easier to use with **CSS** layout and structure.
