- Copy and paste the article directly into the body element of the html.

- The functionality of the **header element (h1~h6)** is to divide the article into different sections and provide the title.
  - A page used only once **h1**, is a good practice. (but not forced)
  - The header elements are **h1 to h6**, so we can implement the concept of **hierarchical** to our page.
- Under the header, the general **paragraph** using element **'p'**, if it is a **list**, there are two cases of **ordered** and **unordered**.

## **Bold and Italic**

- The results are exactly the **same** as those presented by the older elements.
  - Just the difference from **n**o semantic to **has** semantic
