## **Start practice**

### _Codepen_

![Alt minimize editors](pic/bandicam%202022-10-31%2016-47-53-976.jpg)

- Once you enter the editing screen, there will be three kinds of Editor, the part you don't need can be **minimized**.

### _Start to code_

![Alt article](pic/bandicam%202022-10-31%2016-48-44-763.jpg)

- The hint says that we need to complete a certain product in a certain e-commerce page.
  - An element **article** can represent a **physical object** in addition to a blog post.

![Alt h2](pic/bandicam%202022-10-31%2016-49-18-080.jpg)

- Because we only need to complete a small part of a web page, we should not use h1(h1 should be left for the whole web page to use), but start with **h2**.

![Alt img](pic/bandicam%202022-10-31%2016-49-49-081.jpg)

- The attribute src of the element img can be passed in directly using the **URL**.

![Alt p and strong and impty line](pic/bandicam%202022-10-31%2016-51-37-429.jpg)

- The empty line above will not have any effect on the screen displayed on the page, but it will make our html code more readable.
- You can't just use element strong, because then there would be no semantics for the paragraph, and there would be no line break.

### _HTML entities_

![Alt resources of HTML entities](pic/bandicam%202022-10-31%2016-52-46-472.jpg)

- Lecturers have provided web pages for us to look up various **HTML entities**.

![Alt arrow entity](pic/bandicam%202022-10-31%2016-53-15-378.jpg)

![Alt anchor](pic/bandicam%202022-10-31%2016-54-26-251.jpg)

- Since the link address is not specified in the hints, we can use **# as the placeholder** of the URL.

![Alt h3](pic/bandicam%202022-10-31%2016-55-04-079.jpg)

- Because **h2** has been used, so here use **h3**, do not need to think too complicated.

![Alt unorder list](pic/bandicam%202022-10-31%2016-55-28-869.jpg)

![Alt button](pic/bandicam%202022-10-31%2016-55-59-825.jpg)

- If the **button** is functional, you must write the **JavaScript** language, which is outside the scope of this course.

### _Share pen_

![Alt save](pic/bandicam%202022-10-31%2016-56-13-731.jpg)

- Clicking **save** will generate the **pen-specific URL** directly in the browser URL location.
  - but need **login**.
  - We can use this URL to **share** our results with others.
