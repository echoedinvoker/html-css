- HTML 5 element **aside** means **secondary content**, meaning content other than the main article and related to it.
  - Usually the content of the element **aside** is rendered on the right side of the screen, but that's **CSS**'s job, **HTML** only focuses on the **semantics**ã„¡

- Some people may feel that there is no need to use element lists at all, do you agree?
  - In fact, this is **incorrect**. Even though we don't need the element list **presentation**, these three parts do have the **meaning of a list**, so we must use the **element list** to give our html this **'list' semantic**.
    - We can't stop using **element list** because we don't think the **appearance** of the dot generated by the element list is suitable for presentation on a web page.
      - We should use **CSS** to solve **appearence** problem. **HTML** must focus on **semantic**.
