## **Color for Single Element**

![Alt want h1 title have different color](pic/04.jpg)

![Alt set color in css to h1](pic/05.jpg)

![Alt VS Code color picker](pic/06.jpg)

- We usually use **color picker** to select colors or use previously used colors.

## **Color for Multiple Elements**

![Alt h2 h3 also want h1 color](pic/08.jpg)

![Alt use list selector to set color to multiple elements](pic/09.jpg)

## **Color for other text**

![Alt result: h1 h2 h3 have same color](pic/10.jpg)

![Alt use list selector to set color (detail)](pic/11.jpg)

- This **style overwritten** situation requires special attention, and we will have a special lecture on this topic.

## **Background Color Only for Main Header**

![Alt want main header have gray background](pic/12.jpg)

![Alt set gray to header in css](pic/13.jpg)

![Alt set class to main header and use class selector](pic/14.jpg)

## **Top/Bottom Border for Related Posts Section**

![Alt want add top/bottom border to related posts section](pic/15.jpg)

![Alt analyze index.html](pic/16.jpg)

![Alt set aside's background color](pic/17.jpg)

- This feature is convenient because we usually don't want to use too many kinds of colors on a page or a web site.

- However, the current result is a bit different from what we want. We don't want the border to appear on the left and right side, so we have to use **variants of the border property**.

## **Color for Whole Page**

- Related Posts can keep the gray background also because of the **style overwritten**.
